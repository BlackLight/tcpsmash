============================

1. Description
	
	tcpsmash is an application designed to capture packets on a network interface
	and show on standard output, or on a log file, the content of the packet and
	info about the source/dest IP and source/dest port. nctcpsmash is a pseudo-graphical
	interface to tcpsmash developed using NCurses library.

2. Requirements

	In according to be compiled, the application needs

	- A Linux-based system
	- GCC compiler
	- PCAP libraries (http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.htm)
	- NCurses (for nctcpsmash, on Debian-like distros do
	  `apt-get install ncurses-devel' )
	- GC garbage collector, to free unused and allocated memory and prevent
	  memory leaks (if you have not GC installed or want to build (nc)tcpsmash
	  without GC support, build it via
	  `make HAS_GC= LDGC=' )

3. Installation

	goto -> INSTALL

4. Usage

	4.1. tcpsmash

		Usage: tcpsmash [-h] [-l] [-n] [-v] [-q] [-D] [-f "<string>"] [-C "<string"]
			[-w <logfile>] [-F <logfile>] [-c <count>] -i <interface>

		-n
			Do not use promiscuous mode (default mode for tcpsmash)

		-h
			Print this help and exit

		-l
			Show the active network interfaces

		-q
			Generate quick output, with a tcpdump-like flavour

		-D
			Dump each packet on output, without printing additional info

		-v
			Print info about the version of the program

		-w logfile
			Write the output to a log file in binary format. The file will be then read using -F option

		-F logfile
			Read packets from a dump file previously created by using -w <logfile>

		-c count
			Only capture "count" packets and exit

		-f "<string>"
			Use a filter string on the packets in BPF format, i.e. "tcp dst port 80"

		-C "<string>"
			Only capture packets containing "string" in any part of them (headers, application contents...), i.e. "password:"
			You can also specify a regex with this option, between / and /, i.e. -C "/password:\s*[a-z]+/"

		-i interface
			Choose a network interface to sniff

	4.2. nctcpsmash

		Usage: nctcpsmash [-h] [-n] [-v] [-f "<string>"] [-C "<string"] [-c <count>] [-i <interface>]

		-h
			Print this help and exit

		-v
			Print info about the version of the program

		-c count
			Only capture "count" packets and exit

		-f "<string>"
			Use a filter string on the packets in BPF format, i.e. "tcp dst port 80"

		-C "<string>"
			Only capture packets containing "string" in any part of them (headers, application contents...),
			i.e. "password:".
			You can also specify a regex with this option, between / and /, i.e. -C "/password:\s*[a-z]+/"

		-i interface
			Choose a network interface to sniff


		Commands:

		Up/Down arrow:		select previous/next packet
		Left/Right arrow:	goto first/last packet
		Page up/down:		show previous/next page
		ENTER:			show info about selected packet
		h:			show this help
		w:			write dumped traffic to a logfile, to be examined using tcpsmash -F logfile
		s:			pause traffic sniffing
		r:			resume traffic sniffing when paused
		q:			quit (nc)tcpsmash
		t:			if a TCP packet is selected, this command highlights the TCP stream the packet is belonging to
		/ search_pattern | regex:
				highlight (in red) packets containing specified string or regex. To specify a string, just write it.
				To specify a regex, include it between / and / -> /this is a regex/
