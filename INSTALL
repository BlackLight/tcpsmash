=== REQUIMENTS ===

In according to be compiled, the application needs

- A Linux-based system
- GCC compiler
- PCAP libraries (http://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.htm)
- NCurses (for nctcpsmash, on Debian-like distros do
  `apt-get install ncurses-devel' )
- GC garbage collector, to free unused and allocated memory and prevent
  memory leaks (if you have not GC installed or want to build (nc)tcpsmash
  without GC support, build it via
  `make HAS_GC= LDGC=' )

=== INSTALLATION ===

From sources:

$ tar jxvf tcpsmash-VERSION.tar.bz2
$ cd tcpsmash-VERSION

Now you've got two ways to install tcpsmash:

  > 1. Using make
  
  	$ make
	# make install

  > 2. Using jam [ STRONGLY SUGGESTED -> http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html ]

  	$ jam
	# jam install
